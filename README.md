## Icebox Items:
**This project was a proof of concept for React Skills and is not a Finished Product, in the future I'd like to include the following.**

**Player Classes:**
The ability to Choose a Classic Class similar to DND narratives with individual skills

**More Areas to Discover**
I'd like to include more encounter opportunities, and make them dependent on player progress.

**Skills:**
I'd like to introduce skills into the game, to allow the player a bit more than a hack and slash experience.

**Quests / Town:**
I'd like to make it so the player can be assigned Quests and visit the town for Items / interactions.

**Items:**
I'd like to include Items the player can use in battle or equip to alter their stats.
